# What?
NPT allows pipes to only connect to pipes of the same material, including underground pipes! Pipe weaving is now possible!
Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/no-pipe-touching)

# Compatability
- Should be compatible with any mod that adds unique pipes, if something breaks, let me know

## Known compatability:
- Pymods
- RGB Pipes

# History
This is a complete rebuild of the 1.1 version using connection_category, a new feature in the 2.0 modding API. Old versions used scripting and a ton of filler entities. The old code won't be useful... at least here :)

The old version is a revamp of [Incompatible Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/incompatible-pipes) by sticklord. It was rebuilt from the ground up for 1.1.
