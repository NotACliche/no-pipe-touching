# What?
This little mod makes pipes of different materials unable to connect to each other. It doesn't add any pipes on its own, so it's only useful if combined with a mod that adds pipes.

# Compatability
- This mod is 100% compatible with bots and ghosts. No special interactions on your end. The mod does it all.
- Should be compatible with any mod that adds unique pipes, but is only tested with bobs logistics.

# Plans
- Blueprint compatibility, so anything you make with the mod is usable without the mod

# Known Bugs
- Pipes will sometimes be removed when messing with mixing fluids
- nothing else, for now

# History
This is a revamp of [Incompatible Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/incompatible-pipes) by sticklord. It is rebuilt from the ground up for 1.1. It is not finished, so there are guaranteed to be bugs. Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/no-pipe-touching)
